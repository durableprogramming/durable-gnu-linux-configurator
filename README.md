Durable GNU Linux Configurator (DUGNLICO)
========================================

Welcome to the Durable GNU Linux Configurator, a thoughtfully crafted system setup tool designed for Ubuntu 24.04 and newer releases. Born from the Omakub project but rebuilt with durability principles at its core, this configurator helps you establish a stable, maintainable, and efficient Linux workspace.

Getting Started
--------------
To begin installation, simply run:

```bash
source <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/durableprogramming/durable-gnu-linux-configurator/stable/boot.sh)
```

Philosophy and Approach
----------------------
We believe that system configuration should be stable, predictable, and built to last. While we embrace modern tools and practices, we prioritize proven solutions over bleeding-edge technologies. Our configurator makes thoughtful choices that balance innovation with reliability, ensuring your system remains robust and maintainable over time.

Every choice in this configurator has been carefully considered through the lens of long-term sustainability. We favor modular components that can be individually updated or replaced, and we maintain comprehensive documentation to ensure you understand the changes being made to your system.

Features and Capabilities
------------------------
The configurator adapts to your needs, whether you're running a desktop environment or a headless server. For GNOME desktop users, we provide carefully selected UI enhancements and productivity tools. For terminal users, we offer a curated selection of command-line utilities that enhance your workflow without adding unnecessary complexity.

Our installation process is interactive but efficient, allowing you to customize your setup while maintaining sensible defaults. We respect your existing configuration where appropriate and document all changes made to your system.

Support and Community
--------------------
While this project is maintained with care, we encourage users to understand the tools they're installing and to participate in improving them. If you encounter issues or have suggestions, please open an issue on our GitHub repository. We value thoughtful, constructive feedback that helps make the project more durable for everyone.

Extensions and Customization
---------------------------
The configurator supports extensions that add specific functionality while maintaining our core principles of durability and maintainability. See EXTENSIONS.md for available extensions and guidance on creating your own.

License
-------
This project is open source and available under the MIT license. While we encourage commercial use, we also believe in giving back to the community that makes this work possible.
